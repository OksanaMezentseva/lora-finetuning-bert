    "# 🧠 Fine-Tuning BERT with LoRA for Sequence Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to fine-tune a pretrained BERT model using **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** via the `peft` library for a binary **sequence classification task**. The approach leverages **parameter-efficient fine-tuning**, meaning only a small portion of the model is updated during training — making it faster and more memory-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Key Steps Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Load and preprocess dataset** using 🤗 `datasets` and `transformers` tokenizers  \n",
    "- **Apply LoRA** to a `BertForSequenceClassification` model using the `peft` library  \n",
    "- **Tokenize and dynamically pad** text inputs with `DataCollatorWithPadding`  \n",
    "- **Define training arguments** with Hugging Face `TrainingArguments`  \n",
    "- **Log training progress** and metrics with `Weights & Biases (wandb)`  \n",
    "- **Train the model** efficiently using Hugging Face `Trainer`  \n",
    "- **Evaluate performance** using `accuracy`, `f1`, `precision`, and `recall`  \n",
    "- **Review metrics across epochs** and identify the best checkpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📦 Tools & Libraries Used\n",
    "\n",
    "- `transformers` — model loading, tokenization, training\n",
    "- `datasets` — easy access to the dataset\n",
    "- `peft` — for efficient fine-tuning using LoRA\n",
    "- `sklearn` — for metric computation\n",
    "- `wandb` — to visualize and track experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 Why LoRA?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional fine-tuning retrains all model parameters — expensive and slow. LoRA injects **trainable low-rank matrices** into attention layers and trains **only those**, keeping the rest of the model frozen. This drastically reduces training cost without sacrificing performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this notebook, you'll have a high-performing, lightweight BERT classifier — ready for deployment or further experimentation.\n"

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use the dataset **`jackhhao/jailbreak-classification`**, available on the 🤗 Hugging Face Hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📌 Purpose:\n",
    "The dataset is designed to train and evaluate models on their ability to **classify prompts** as either:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"jailbreak\"** — prompts attempting to bypass AI safety mechanisms (e.g., trying to make a model say something harmful, unsafe, or restricted)\n",
    "- **\"benign\"** — safe, standard prompts with no harmful intent\n",
    "\n",
    "This task is important in the context of **AI safety**, especially for large language models (LLMs), where detecting and preventing harmful usage is a priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Dataset Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of two splits:\n",
    "- `train`\n",
    "- `test`\n",
    "\n",
    "Each sample includes:\n",
    "- `prompt`: the input text given to the model\n",
    "- `type`: the label (either `\"jailbreak\"` or `\"benign\"`)"

    "- **TrainingArguments**: Configuration is defined for the evaluation process, including batch size, logging directory, and disabling external loggers like Weights & Biases (`report_to=[]`).\n",

    "### 🔧 LoRA Configuration for Sequence Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we define a configuration for applying **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** to a sequence classification task using the `peft` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📦 Library: `peft`\n",
    "- The `peft` library enables **parameter-efficient fine-tuning** of large language models.\n",
    "- Instead of updating all model weights, LoRA injects small trainable matrices into selected layers, reducing memory and compute requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧩 What the configuration means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `task_type=TaskType.SEQ_CLS`  \n",
    "  Specifies the task type as **sequence classification**, e.g., sentiment analysis, toxicity detection, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `r=32`  \n",
    "  Defines the **rank** of the low-rank matrices. Higher values improve expressiveness but increase training size.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `lora_alpha=16`  \n",
    "  A scaling factor that determines the strength of the LoRA update. The output of LoRA is scaled by this value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This configuration tells the `peft` system:\n",
    "- \"I want to fine-tune only a small number of parameters\"\n",
    "- \"The model is for sequence classification\"\n",
    "- \"Use low-rank matrices of size 32 and scale them with α = 16\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ⚡️Why it matters:\n",
    "Using LoRA allows you to fine-tune large models like BERT or LLaMA on consumer hardware, with:\n",
    "- drastically fewer trainable parameters\n",
    "- minimal impact on performance (if `r` is well-chosen)\n",
    "- fast training and reduced overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "This is especially helpful for cases where:\n",
    "- GPU memory is limited\n",
    "- training time must be short\n",
    "- multiple personalized models are needed\n"
